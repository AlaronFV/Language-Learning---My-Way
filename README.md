Streamlit script for a webapp for bilingual reading for language learning. Put bilingual text in webapp/input/{you_name_it}.txt in format of "source\ntarget" with "\n\n" separating each entry. Run streamlit on webapp/main.py, and use preparer to make the actual file for learning. Learn. Backup of vocab file is manual just for the reason of control. If you know how to use it, it will work. I know how to use it, for me it is working. How to make it accessible? I have no clue. Treat it as a proof of concept for an app that combines Toucan chrome extension with i+1 like ankimorph from anki with your own context, that matters to you, for your choice for bilingual text.
